# Game of Life

A Swift implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The project uses Swift Package Manager. You can run the tests with `swift test`. The easiest way to work on the project is to use `swift build generate-xcodeproj` and open the resulting `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
